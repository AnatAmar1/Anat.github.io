The concept of design patterns originated with architect Christopher Alexander in the 1970s, primarily in the realm of building architecture. Despite not being a software architect, Alexander's groundbreaking work in architecture laid the foundation for the idea of design patterns. His educational background in physics, and chemistry, and a master's degree in mathematics, coupled with practical experience as a contractor, uniquely positioned him to identify recurring patterns in building structures.

Christopher Alexander's design patterns weren't merely specific to his creations; they reflected universal principles observed throughout history and across diverse cultures. He discerned a certain "rightness" or inherent power within these patterns, something worth refining, learning, and teaching.

The intersection between Alexander's architectural principles and object-oriented software design occurred with the publication of the book "Design Patterns." Co-authored by four individuals with substantial backgrounds in computer science, the book became a bestseller, hailed as "one of the most influential and practical books that preceded the Academy by years." It elegantly described programming problems and provided object-oriented solutions that emphasized abstraction and flexibility for future expansion.

As a student in software engineering, I frequently encounter design patterns when developing applications, striving to produce code that is not only functional but also readable, maintainable, and reusable. One such example is the Observer Design Pattern in JavaScript:


In this pattern, the UML diagram showcases the subject, observer, and concrete objects as essential components. The subject maintains references to concrete observers, notifying them of changes. The observer object, designed as a generic class, enables concrete observers to utilize the notify method.

In essence, design patterns in software engineering offer general solutions to common problems. They serve as templates for problem-solving, providing descriptions that guide the development process rather than rigid, finalized designs handed over to the coding phase. The integration of such patterns enhances the quality and adaptability of software solutions.
