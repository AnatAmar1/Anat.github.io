Embarking on the journey of software engineering has equipped me with a skill set poised for the future, blending creativity with technical prowess, programming, and graphic design. The challenge and allure of constructing a website from scratch captivate my interest deeply.

In the realm of web development, which encompasses everything related to website creation, I find the front-end development particularly intriguing. It revolves around the end-user experience, encompassing elements such as images, buttons, and forms. As a front-end developer, my responsibilities include crafting code to define a site's layout, content, and interactive features. This involves setting up the display of various elements, from text formatting to image placement, and creating engaging interactive components like buttons.

Web development relies on three primary languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While these languages form the foundation, utilizing UI frameworks accelerates webpage development. Semantic UI, an open-source customizable framework, streamlines the process with pre-built elements like icons, images, and buttons, facilitating the rapid creation of attractive web pages.

In the software development cycle, debugging emerges as a critical task. Recognizing the importance of writing clean and error-free code, I leverage tools like ESLint. This tool not only automates the identification of syntax or style errors but also promotes the writing of better, correct, and more readable code. ESLint's quick-fix capability for errors, denoted by red underlines, and its highlighting of style issues with green underlines significantly contribute to code quality. Working on team projects, ESLint ensures uniformity in code and aids in bug prevention, making it an invaluable asset for any JavaScript developer aspiring to enhance professionalism.

Opting for a bachelor's degree in Computer Science stems from my passion for problem-solving creativity. The vast array of programming languages and areas—HTML, Javascript, Java, C++, C#, Ruby, Python—offers endless learning possibilities. Programming, with its multitude of answers to every question and varied problem-solving approaches, provides constant satisfaction. As I work towards my B.S. in computer science, my aspiration is to contribute as a software engineer, leveraging the diverse and dynamic opportunities for growth and specialization in the ever-evolving world of programming.
