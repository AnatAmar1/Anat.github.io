As a crucial team member, I spearheaded the design and implementation of the user interface and admin page for an innovative Social-Gaming-Web-Platform tailored to children with developmental delays. My unwavering commitment to quality included extensive testing using TestCafe, ensuring a flawless user experience. Leveraging JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, and Bootstrap, I crafted a seamless and engaging landing page that introduces interactive games designed to capture and assess children's behavior. The landing page serves as a vibrant gateway, showcasing the diverse range of therapeutic games offered, each meticulously designed to support children's development and behavioral needs.
